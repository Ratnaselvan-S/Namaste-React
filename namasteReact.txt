Types of testing

-unit testing 
-Integration testing
- end to end testing 

--------------------------------------------------------------
--testing library (React testing library -@testing-library/react) it needs jest 
--jest is the testing library for javascript 
--the jest testing environment uses jsdom library to execute the react component it is like browser
and jest does not understand modern es6 js and react jsx we need to download and config bebel-env and bebel-react



__means dunder test


---------------------------------------------------------------------
to check whether the given component jsx is present in the document ,we use a library( "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.6.3",) this will have the function {tobeinthedocument()}


.getbyRole() tag name

.getbytext() string int he component

.getbyplaceholdername() checks any placeholder name is there or notin input

if multiple element present in screen then we can give  getallby if not put it gives error

then if multiple we can put length tobe(2)


-----------------------
describe is just used to group the test cases it also epect string and function

instead of "test" some people used to write "it" there is no difference here 



----------------------------------
we can pass the button name login as regex also this willl just say if the word is present or not (it is just not find the exact value of string if cart string is present then the case is passes)


we can fire the onclick even using fireevent in testing


----------------------------------
npm run test everytime we need to run this so instead we can write watch-test :jest --watch

-------------------------------------

whenever  there is async or state update we need to put "act" funtion  in testing so that it wont fail

----------------------------------------
before all,before each ,after all ,after each
