zustand is like same as redux library ,this is gaining popularity 


dispatch an action on add button then that action will call a function and then the fuction will modify the cart data (the function is known as reducer) this 
will update the slice of the redux store 


we use selector to get the data from redux store (selector is subscribe to the store so whenever the data changes the data automaticaaly changes on the ui)



i have pasted the redux detailed photo on the image make it for reference


##redux install and config

--install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
--Build our store 
--connect the store to our app
--create an slice (cart)


selector is justa hook to subrcribe to the data 
immer --redux uses to update the immutable state to state here it will compare the state with older mutable state and return the state new value
if we need to console log the state in redux di this current(state)
