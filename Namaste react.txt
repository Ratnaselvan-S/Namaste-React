why we need to always write super(props) in class based component ----homework



never update direstly the class based state variable

this.setstate need to check how it will only changes the portion of the varaible


parent constructor called
parent render called
child constructor called
child render called
child componentdidmount called
parent  componentdidmount called



render  phase       }         
commit phase        } react lifecycle diagram refer projects.wojteckmaj




so  useeffect return  takes a function which is same as componentdidunmount
