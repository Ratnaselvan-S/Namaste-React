npx parcel index.html -- instead of this i can put the parcel index.html in the package.json file and just put npm run start


jsx is like html like syntax in javascript file


const heading=<h1> hello worls</h1> here the javascript cannt understand the jsx syntax because javascript engine understands only es(ecma script) and here the jsx is converted
into first  react.createelement it is done by parcel but parcel is a manager its dependensies such as babel is responsible for its conversion


and babel also convert browser compactible js 

give an attribute to jsx give it is camel casing


component composition ---it is nothing but using two component  inside a same  javascript file


while injecting any javascript code like '{} ' it usually escaapes that is it ssnitize the code so that the cross site scripting ccan be prevented
